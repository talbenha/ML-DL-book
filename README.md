# (Ongoing Book) Deep Learning: From Zero to Hero

## Purpose
Machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence (AI) are rapidly evolving fields that has transformed the way we live, work, and interact with technology. It has become an integral part of many industries, including healthcare, finance, transportation, and more. As the world becomes increasingly data-driven, the ability to extract insights from large datasets has become critical for businesses and individuals alike. In this ongoing book, we explore the fundamentals of machine learning, from the basics of data analysis and modeling to the latest advancements in artificial intelligence. Through practical examples and real-world applications, we provide a comprehensive overview of this exciting and dynamic field.
